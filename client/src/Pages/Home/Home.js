        <h6>This site was created as a free educational resource for starting physics and engineering students. Studying for the first time can feel overwhelming: the proficiency in math is demanding, the concepts can be nebulous, and the content you're studying is highly dependent on prior content mastery.</h6>
        <h6>Let this site help guide your studies. I hope to break down highschool and college-level Introductory Physics content into manageable chunks, with examples and knowledge checks throughout.</h6>
